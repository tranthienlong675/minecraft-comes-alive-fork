Initial Release

* Added Sirben female noises, thanks mintymacaron!
* Improved guard behavior when players attack villagers.
    * Guards now keep chasing attackers long enough to deliver their warning hits.
    * Guards now warn, attack and pardon more consistently based on the player's warning level.
    * Guard warning dialogue no longer stacks with the normal "ouch" dialogue on the same hit.
* Improved archer guards in combat.
    * Archers now draw and fire bows more reliably.
    * Archer arrows should no longer be blocked by normal hurt immunity during fast combat.
    * Left-handed villagers still look left-handed, while bows and weapons stay in the correct hand for Minecraft's
      combat checks.
* Guards without a home village can now wander instead of standing idle.
* Villagers and guards can now visibly eat food to recover health when they are safe and out of combat.
* Improved villager movement around awkward decorative blocks such as lanterns, which could previously confuse
  pathfinding.
    * Added a new MCA pathfinding tag so modpacks and addons can mark custom blocks with unusual collision shapes.
    * Added config options for extra collision checks while villagers pathfind.
    * The broader collision-check option is off by default, but can help modpacks with many custom block shapes.
* Fixed `bountyHunterInterval <= 0` crashing
* Fixed some mods breaking lighting rituals on fire.

# 7.7.18-beta.10

* Improved smart selection filtering in the polymorph UI: the generic **House** option is automatically filtered out if
  **Big House** is also matched, preventing unnecessary choice prompts when scanning.
* Empty icons don't render as graveyard anymore, House option now has an icon.
* Improved building removal logic.

# 7.7.18-beta.9

* The **Ride Mount** button on the villager interaction screen now changes to **Dismount** if the villager is riding
  something, making it easy to get them down.
* Fixed a bug on dedicated servers where changing a villager's mood, infection, traits, personality, or relationship
  hearts in the editor wouldn't save.
* Improved how villager skins and clothing registries are loaded behind the scenes to be cleaner and more flexible.

* Added a **Music Store** building.
    * Villagers can now visit the Music Store when they are feeling sad.
    * This helps raise their happiness, similar to how the inn works.

* Improved overlapping building detection.
    * When multiple building structures overlap, you can now choose which one should be used.

* Improved villager AI performance.
    * Villagers now do less unnecessary work every tick.
    * Large villages should have fewer lag spikes and smoother server performance.
    * Guard enemy scans are now cheaper, running only for villagers actively guarding, following a player, or fighting (
      non-combat villagers skip this scan entirely to save performance).
    * Villagers are less likely to waste pathfinding work when moving around the village.
    * Villagers should no longer forget homes or jobs just because a path search briefly failed.
    * Equipment checks for guards and archers are now cached, reducing repeated work.
    * Villager health bonus updates are now cached instead of being recalculated every tick.

* Fixed an issue where some villager movement state updates were running far more often than intended.
* Fixed excessive repeated max-health modifier updates on villagers.
* Fixed some expensive villager walking logic that could retry too many times in one tick by adding a retry cooldown
  after failed attempts.

# 7.7.18-beta.6

* Removed old Head category from Destiny Screen.

# 7.7.18-beta.5

* Added a configuration option to choose the headstone/grave type spawned when a villager dies.

* Internal networking changes to hopefully make multiplayer work properly.
    * As a result, generally especially in multiplayer sessions, UI changes are faster.
* Fixed library clothing previews hiding legacy hair.
* Selecting clothing generally or picking an outfit no longer hides hair.
    * This was done initially because of the new hair system, however, if the hair overlaps with your character, you can
      just select the bald hair option
      in the hair screen.
* Prevented babies, children, and non-spouse relatives from flirting, kissing, or accepting romantic items (bouquets,
  engagement rings).
* Age-locked the `Flirty` personality so it cannot be assigned to babies, toddlers, or children.
* Added personality re-randomization when villagers age up to allow true character development and natural trait
  changes.
    *
        - So children will change their personality.

    * If you'd like to remove the trait, you can do so in the MCA Debug Book.
* Experimental JourneyMap compatibility.
